Chapter 3 - Asset Management 
Information and information systems services constitute valuable government resources. The asset management chapter establishes the blueprint to identify the rules of acceptable use and the rules for protection: what assets to protect, who protects them and how much protection is adequate. 
 
To account for the assets that require protection, this chapter specifies the requirement to designate who owns assets. Designated owners become responsible for protecting information and technology assets and to maintain the way assets are protected. 
 
This chapter sets the foundation for a system that classifies information to identify different security levels, to specify how much protection is expected and how information should be handled at each level. Not all the information requires the same level of protection because only some information is sensitive or confidential. 
3.1     Responsibility for assets 
3.1.1 
      Inventory of assets 
    An inventory of all important assets associated with information systems must be documented and maintained. 
3.1.2 
      Ownership of assets 
    Information Owners and Information Custodians must be designated for all assets associated with information systems. 
3.1.3 
      Acceptable use of assets 
    Rules for the acceptable use of information systems must be identified, documented, and implemented. 
3.2     Information Classification 
3.2.1 
      Classification guidelines 
    The government information security classification system must take into account the value, sensitivity and intended use of the information. 
3.2.2 
      Information labelling and handling 
    Information must be identified, labelled when appropriate and handled in accordance with the assigned information security classification.

For example, Information Security Classifications assist in: 
•    Consistent, comparable Statement of Sensitivity descriptions of the Security Threat and Risk Assessment describing the confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements of the assessed system. 
•    The selection of system security controls: Service providers can bundle system security controls into packages or service offerings based on the consistently defined protection requirements of the information. 
•    The selection of, and consistent application of, information handling and labeling rules. 
•    Information sharing agreements by indicating the relative value of information being exchanged in a consistent and comparable manner across government. 
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Is there a process to ensure the Information Security Classification System is being used? 
•    Is the Information Security Classification part of the System Security Plan?

5.1     Physical and Environmental Security - Secure areas 
5.1.1     Government information processing facilities must be protected by a physical security perimeter. 
a)    Security perimeter 
b)    Maintenance 
Purpose:     To prevent unauthorized physical access to government information processing facilities. 
5.1.1 a) Security perimeter 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must establish the appropriate type and number of restricted zones to achieve the necessary conditions for personnel safety, and for the protection of, sensitive or valuable information and assets. Establishment of restricted zones must be supported by a Security Threat and Risk Assessment. 
 
All information processing facilities are a Restricted Access Security Zone. 
 
Appropriate security controls must be applied to reduce the level of identified risks and include: 
•    A structure that prevents external visual and audio observations and complies with all local building codes for structural stability (external walls, internal walls, ceilings and doors). Walls surrounding the facility must be extended from true floor to true ceiling (slab to slab), to prevent unauthorized entry and minimize environmental contaminations such as that caused by fires and floods. Appropriate control mechanisms (e.g., locks, alarms and bars on windows and doors) must be applied to prevent unauthorized access; 
•    All information processing facilities must be equipped with physical intrusion alarm systems that automatically alert monitoring staff to take immediate action; 
•    Information processing facilities must be equipped with doors that close automatically. These doors must set off an audible alarm when kept open beyond a certain period of time; 
•    All fire doors must be equipped with crash bars to allow a quick exit in the event of an emergency. 
When the doors are opened an audible alarm may also be set off;
•    Alarm systems must be continuously monitored (i.e., 24 hours a day, 7 days a week); 
•    Access to restricted zones must be controlled, authorized and monitored as required by the applicable zone; 
•    Government information processing facilities must be physically separated from those managed by third parties. 
5.1.1 b) Maintenance 
Information Custodians must review, and where appropriate test, physical security and environmental control requirements annually.  
 
Security requirements for facilities must be evaluated prior to significant: 
•    Alteration to building layouts; 
•    Change to equipment/systems located in the facility; 
•    Change in operations
•    As part of any related security incident investigation. 
Standards: 
Physical Security Zones Standards 
Information Security Threat and Risk Assessment Standard  
Guidelines: 
The following guidelines support physical and environmental security by establishing perimeter security for information processing facilities: 
•    Common service spaces such as eating areas, washrooms, cloakrooms, boardrooms and storage areas should be located so that they cannot be used to circumvent physical security; 
•    Visitor reception should be separate from entrance areas but provide an unobstructed view of the entrance; 
•    When physical security is outsourced, the contract must require that contracted personnel are security screened and bonded. 
 
The effective use of restricted access zones in an open office environment depends on the implementation of appropriate security procedures, which may include: 
•    Respecting the need-to-access principle and zone perimeters; 
•    Escorting visitors; 
•    Securing sensitive or valuable information and assets when leaving the work areas; 
•    Taking precautions when discussing sensitive information. 
Authority and Exceptions: 
Physical security for information processing facilities is the responsibility of the Information Custodian. 
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Are security requirements reviewed annually? 
•    Are security controls tested annually?

6.10.1 Audit logs recording user activities, exceptions and information security events must be produced and kept to assist in access control monitoring and future investigations. 
a) Audit logging 
b)    Audit log retention 
c)    Response to alarms 
Purpose:     To ensure usage of information systems can be monitored and audited. 
6.10.1 a) Audit logging 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must ensure that audit logs are used to record user and system activities, exceptions and information security and operational events including information about activity on networks, applications and systems. Information Owners and Information Custodians will determine the degree of detail to be logged based on the value and sensitivity of information assets, the criticality of the system and the resources required to review and analyze the audit logs. Audit logs should include, when relevant, the following information: 
•    User identifier; 
•    Dates, times and details of key events (e.g., logon and logoff); 
•    Logon method, location, terminal identity (if possible), network address; 
•    Records of successful and unsuccessful system access attempts; 
•    Records of successful and unsuccessful data access (including record and field access where applicable) and other resource access attempts; 
•    Changes to system configuration; 
•    Use of privileges; 
•    Use of system utilities and applications; 
•    Files accessed and type of access (e.g., view, read, modify, delete); 
•    Network addresses and protocols; 
•    Alarms raised by the access control system
•    Activation and de-activation of protection systems (e.g., anti-virus, intrusion detection). 
 
Audit logs may contain confidential data and access must be restricted to personnel with ‘need-to-know’ privileged access and be protected accordingly. 
 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must not have the ability to modify, erase or de-activate logs of their own activities. 
 
If audit logs are not activated, this decision must be documented and include the name and position of the approver, date and a rationale for de-activating the log. Where required, the Privacy Impact Assessment and/or Security Threat and Risk Assessment must be updated to reflect this decision. 
6.10.1 b) Audit log retention 
Audit logs must be: 
•    Retained according to the approved records retention schedule for the system or information asset
•    Retained indefinitely if an investigation has commenced which may require evidence be obtained from the audit logs. 
6.10.1 c) Response to alarms 
Information Custodians must establish and document alarm response procedures in collaboration with Information Owners to ensure alarms are responded to immediately and consistently. 
 
Information Custodians should have documented authority to shut down all or part of a system or network when the alarm indicates new unacceptable threats are present. When exercising this authority Information Custodians must report the circumstances to the Information Owners as soon as possible. 
 
Normally, the response to an alarm will include: 
•    Identification of the alarm event; 
•    Isolation of the event including affected assets; 
•    Identification and isolation or neutralization of the source; 
•    Corrective action; 
•    Forensic analysis of event; • Action to prevent recurrence; 
•    Securing of audit logs as evidence.

b)    Review of monitoring activities 
Purpose:     To detect unusual or unauthorized use of information systems. 
6.10.2 a) Monitoring the use of information systems 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must ensure that the use of information systems can be monitored to detect activities including: authorized and unauthorized accesses, system alerts and failures. Information Owners and Information Custodians must identify the activities to be reported as part of an exception reporting process. Information custodians must implement, manage and monitor logging systems for: 
•    Authorized access, including: 
o    User identifier, 
o    Date and time of log on and log off, o Type of event(s), o Files accessed, and, 
o    Programs, privileges and/or utilities used; 
•    Privileged operations, including: 
o    Use of privileged accounts (e.g., System Administrator, Data Base Administrator) o System start-up and shutdown, and, 
o    Input/Output device attachment and/or detachment;

•    System alerts or failures, including: 
o    Console alerts or messages, o System log exceptions, o Network management alarms, and, o Access control system alarms
•    Changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls. 
6.10.2 b) Review of monitoring activities 
Information Custodians must set up and document processes for the review of audit logs based on the Information Owners assessment of the value and sensitivity of the information assets, the criticality of the system and the resources required for review.  
 
Audit log reviews should: 
•    Prioritize reviews of high value and highly sensitive information assets, 
•    Be based on a documented security threat and risk assessment, 
•    Utilize automated tools to identify exceptions (e.g., failed access attempts, unusual activity) and facilitate ongoing analysis and review. 
 
Monitoring should be tested at least annually to ensure that desired events are detected. Analysis of monitoring activities can indicate: 
•    The efficacy of user awareness and training and indicate new training requirements; 
•    Vulnerabilities that could be, or that are being, exploited; or 
•    Increases or decreases in unauthorized access attempts or unauthorized use of privileges. 
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Are the processes for review of audit logs documented commensurate with the value and sensitivity of the information? 
•    Have the monitoring requirements (short and long term trend analysis) been established and documented? 
•    Are the exception reports reviewed at least annually? 
•    Is the adequacy and accuracy of monitoring reviewed annually?

•    Support and enable business requirements identified in Privacy Impact Assessments; 
•    Be based upon Security Threat and Risk Assessments
•    Include classification of assets. 
 
Access control policies must additionally: 
•    Consider both physical and logical access to assets; 
•    Apply the “need to know” and “least privilege” principles; 
•    Set default access privileges to “deny-all” prior to granting access; 
•    Require access by unique user identifiers or system process identifiers to ensure that all access actions are auditable; 
•    Have permissions assigned to roles rather than individual user identifiers. 
 
The access control policy must be communicated to personnel as part of awareness training. 
7.1.1 b) Access control policy management 
Information Owners and Information Custodians are responsible for establishing processes to manage the access control policies, including: 
•    Ensuring the process is communicated to all personnel;

7.2.1     There must be a formal user registration and de-registration process for granting access to all information systems.
a) Registration 
b) Deregistration 
Purpose:     To ensure that all access actions are traceable to an identifiable individual or process. 
7.2.1 a) Registration 
Information Owners and Information Custodians are responsible for managing access to the assets under their control and must implement registration processes which: 
•    Requires custodians to approve all access rights. This process should: 
o    ensure access requests are approved by the supervisor/manager of the user requesting access, and, 
o    ensure the reasons for requesting access are consistent with job responsibilities; 
•    Maintain records of access right approvals; 
•    Ensures personnel understand the conditions of access and, when appropriate, have signed confidentiality agreements; 
•    Ensures access rights are consistent with the data uses documented in the approved Privacy Impact Assessment; 
•    Ensures accesses are traceable to an identifiable individual or process; 
•    Ensures each user is assigned a single unique identifier for accessing information systems. (See Exceptions section below); 
 
•    Ensures the responsibilities for authorizing access are segregated from the responsibilities for granting access; 
•    Restricts access by using predefined role permissions; 
•    Provides secure and separate transmission of the user identifier and password to the user
•    In exceptional cases, where warranted by the classification of the asset and supported by a Security Threat and Risk Assessment, ensures enhanced user security screening or background checks are completed prior to authorizing access. 
7.2.1 b) Deregistration 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must formally assign responsibilities and implement processes to: 
•    Remove access privileges for employees no longer with the organization within 5 working days; 
•    Promptly review access rights whenever a user changes duties and responsibilities; 
•    Promptly review access rights whenever the user’s branch or department is involved in significant reorganization; 
•    Review access privileges for employees on extended absence or temporary assignments within 10 working days of the change of status; 
•    Remove access privileges for employees terminated for cause concurrent with notification to individual
•    Quarterly check for and remove inactive or redundant user identifiers. 
Authority and Exceptions: 
Individual users may have multiple identifiers when: 
•    Required to meet limitations of technology. (e.g., IDIR, MVS)  
•    Required to meet unique business requirements provided the rationale is documented and approved by the Information Owner or Information Custodian as appropriate. 
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Is there a process for user registration and deregistration?

7.2.2     The allocation and use of system privileges must be restricted and controlled. 
a) Managing, restricting and controlling the allocation and use of system privileges 
Purpose:     To prevent unauthorized access to multi-user information systems. 
 
7.2.2 a) Managing, restricting and controlling the allocation and use of system privileges 
Information Owners and Information Custodians are responsible for authorizing system privileges and must: 
•    Identify and document the system privileges associated with each information system or service; 
•    Ensure the process for requesting and approving access to system privileges includes management approval(s) prior to granting of system privileges; 
•    Ensure processes are implemented to remove system privileges from users concurrent with changes in job status (e.g., transfer, promotion, termination); 
•    Limit access to the fewest number of users needed to operate or maintain the system or service; 
•    Ensure the access rights granted are limited to and consistent with the users’ job function and responsibilities; 
•    Maintain a record of users granted access to system privileges; 
•    Ensure use of system privileges is recorded in audit logs which are unalterable by the privileged user; 
•    Implement processes for ongoing compliance checking of the use of system privileges
•    Implement processes for regular review of authorizations in place to confirm that access is still needed and that the least number of users needed have access. 
 
User identifiers with system privileges must only be used for performing privileged functions and not used to perform regular activities. User identifiers established to perform regular activities must not be used to perform privileged functions. 
Guidelines: 
•    The design of information systems should include processes for performing regular maintenance activities which avoid the requirement of system privileges. 
•    Whenever possible system routines should be used to execute system privileges rather than granting system privileges to individual users. 
•    System acquisition and development should encourage use of programs which minimize the need for users to operate with system privileges. 
 
Privileged users should: 
•    Not read the data of an information asset unless authorized; 
•    Be able to alter user permissions for an information asset
•    Be permitted to view, but not alter, user activity logs as part of security safeguards. 
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Is the use of system privileges reviewed regularly (e.g., usage logs)? 
•    Are access rights to system privileges reviewed concurrent with personnel changes? 
•    Are access rights to system privileges reviewed regularly?

b)    Managing the issuance of privileged user credentials 
c)    Managing the issuance of multiple factors of authentication credentials 
Purpose:     To define the formal management processes for issuing passwords. 
7.2.3 a) Managing the issuance of passwords 
Ministries must formally designate individuals who have the authority to issue and reset passwords. The following applies: 
•    Passwords shall only be issued to users whose identity is confirmed prior to issuance; 
•    Individuals with the authority to reset passwords must transmit new or reset passwords to the user in a secure manner (e.g., using encryption, using a secondary channel); 
•    Whenever technically possible temporary passwords must be unique to each individual and must not be easily guessable; 
•    Passwords must never be stored in an unprotected form
•    Default passwords provided by technology vendors must be changed to a password compliant with government standards during the installation of the technology (hardware or software). 
7.2.3 b) Managing the issuance of privileged user credentials  
The issuance of privileged user credentials must have two levels of approval. Use of system privileges should require use of multi-factor authentication. 
7.2.3 c) Managing the issuance of multiple factors of authentication credentials  
The management of issuance of multiple factors of authentication credential is covered in Cryptographic Standard for Information Protection. 
Standards: 
Electronic Credential and Authentication Standard Cryptographic Standard for Information Protection

Purpose:     To ensure that access rights only exist for users with a defined “need to know”. 
7.2.4 a) Circumstances and criteria for formal access right review 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must implement formal processes for the regular review of access rights. Access rights must be reviewed: 
•    Annually; 
•    More frequently for high value information assets and privileged users; 
•    When a user’s status changes as the result of a promotion, demotion, removal from a user group, re-assignment, transfer or other change that may affect a user’s need to access information assets; (See ISP 4.3.3 for requirements at termination of employment or contract); 
•    As part of a major reorganization, or the introduction of new technology or applications
•    When Information Owners and Information Custodians change the access control policy the access rights must be reviewed. 
7.2.4 b) Procedure for formal access right review 
Review of access rights must include the following: 
•    Confirmation that access rights are based on the “need to know” and “least privilege” principles; 
•    Confirmation that all members of the group/role have a need to know; 
•    Reviews and verification of access control lists are dated and signed by the reviewer and kept for audit purposes
•    Confirmation that changes to access rights are logged and auditable. 
 
Access control logs and reports are government records and must be retained and disposed of in accordance with approved record management schedules.

7.3     Access Control - User responsibilities 
7.3.1     Users must follow good security practices in the selection and use of passwords.
a) Selection of passwords 
b)    Password change 
c)    Privileged accounts 
d)    Protection and use of passwords 
Purpose:     To maintain the integrity of the unique identifier (user id) by ensuring users follow good security practices. 
7.3.1 a) Selection of passwords 
When selecting passwords users must: 
•    Select complex passwords, i.e., a mixture of characters as specified in the Standard
•    Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. 
 
The effectiveness of access control measures is strengthened when users adopt good security practices for selecting passwords. 
7.3.1 b) Password change 
Passwords must be changed: 
•    During installation of computer hardware and or software which is delivered with a default password; 
•    Immediately if a password is compromised or if compromise is suspected. If compromise has taken place or is suspected the incident must be reported in accordance with ISP 9.1.1
•    Comply with password change instructions issued by an automated process (e.g., password lifecycle replacement) or an appropriate authority. 
7.3.1 c) Privileged accounts 
Privileged accounts have wider and more powerful access rights to information assets. In addition to 7.3.1 a) and b) users authorized to create or who hold privileged accounts must: 
•    Use passwords which are at least 15 characters where technically feasible
•    Change passwords more frequently than a password for normal account. 
7.3.1 d) Protection and use of passwords 
Passwords are highly sensitive and must be protected by not: 
•    Sharing or disclosing passwords; 
•    Permitting anyone to view the password as it is being entered; 
•    Writing down a password; 
•    Storing other personal identifiers, access codes, tokens or passwords in the same container as the token; 
•    Keeping a file of passwords on any computer system, including mobile devices unless that file is encrypted according to the Cryptographic Standards for Information Protection; and 
•    Employing any automatic or scripted logon processes for personal identifiers 
•    Using personal identifiers, access codes, or passwords associated with Government accounts for non-government purposes. 
Standards: 
The Complex Password Standard for government systems requires that passwords: 
•    Contain a minimum of 8 characters; 
•    Contain characters from three of the following categories: 
o    English upper case characters (A to Z), o English lower case characters (a to z), o numerals (0 to 9), and, 
o    non-alphanumeric keyboard symbols (e.g., ! $ # %)
•    Not contain the user name or any proper names of the user. 
 
For example, the complex password “T#ocitpi7”is derived from the phrase “The number of clowns in the parade is seven”. Complexity can be further increased by substituting numbers for vowels. 
 
Electronic Credential and Authentication Standard Cryptographic Standards for Information Protection 
Guidelines: 
Never divulge your password to anyone. Legitimate IT technical support staff such as systems administrators, helpdesk and security will not ask users for their passwords. 
Authority and Exceptions: 
Exception granted to RACF and VM Secure due to technical product limitations. 
 
Where a business need is defined to keep written records of passwords an exception may be granted. 
 
For mobile devices connecting to the government messaging server, the following password rules apply: 
•    Passwords must contain a minimum of 6 characters; 
•    Controls should be in place to prevent the use of overly simple passwords
•    The use of complex passwords is not mandatory; however, the use of a combination of numbers, symbols, upper and lower case characters is recommended to increase the password strength.  
Metrics and Enforcement: 
•    Are password requirements communicated to users?

Information Owners must ensure that Information Custodians configure logon processes to: 
•    Record unsuccessful logon attempts; 
•    Allow a limited number of unsuccessful logon attempts; 
•    Limit the maximum and minimum time allowed for the logon procedure. If exceeded, the system should terminate the logon
•    Force a time delay or reject further logon attempts if the limited number of consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts is reached. 
7.5.1 c) Password transmission 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must ensure logon processes are configured to prevent transmission of passwords in clear text. 
Standards: 
After three consecutive failed logon attempts for an account the logon process must: 
•    Lock the account and require Administrator intervention; or, 
•    Lock the account for 15 minutes and then allow a further three logon attempts. 
Guidelines: 
The logon procedure should permit users to monitor the security of their account by displaying the following information on completion of a successful logon: 
•    Date and time of the previous successful logon
•    Details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful logon.

o    manage the assignment and issuance of user identifiers, 
o    ensure that users, except for privileged users, are not issued multiple identifiers for any one information system or platform, and, 
o    record user status (e.g., employee, contractor); 
•    Identification of those individuals or positions authorized to request new user identifiers; 
•    Confirmation that the user has been informed of appropriate use policies; 
•    Automated linkages with the personnel management system (i.e. CHIPS) to identify transfers, terminations and extended leave actions to initiate the suspension or cancellation of user identifiers; 
•    Linkages with contract management offices and/or contract managers to identify and maintain the status of identifiers issued to contractors
•    Conducting annual reviews to confirm the continued requirement for the user identifier. 
 
To segregate roles or functions, privileged users may be issued multiple identifiers for an information system or platform. 
7.5.2 b) Authentication of identity 
Information Owners and Information Custodians must ensure that user identifiers are authenticated by an approved authentication mechanism. 
 
User identifiers authenticated by means other than a password must use a mechanism approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. 
7.5.2 c) Shared user identifiers 
In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit identified by the Information Owner or Information Custodian, the use of a positional user identifier for a group of users or a specific job can be used, provided: 
•    Positional user identifiers are not used for privileged users
•    The Manager responsible for the position using the positional user identifier: 
o    Maintains a record of the name of the individual, the user identifier, and the start- and enddate of use, and, 
o    Deactivates the user identifier when not in use by requesting a password reset.

o    implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, and, o reporting action taken; 
•    Staff with responsibilities for information security investigations (investigating officer) must be aware of processes for securing potential evidence such as technology assets (e.g., PCs), audit logs, audit trails, voice mail and e-mail accounts for analysis and as potential evidence in legal proceedings; 
•    Inappropriate use of information and technology resources requires that within 48 hours the investigating officer contact: 
o    in the case of an employee the individual’s excluded Manager and BC Public Service Agency 
(BCPSA) Labour Relations, and, o in the case of a contractor or business partner the contract manager or relationship manager; 
•    When criminal activity is suspected, the investigating officer must ensure that the appropriate law enforcement authorities are contacted. However, before contacting law enforcement authorities the Risk Management Branch and Government Security Office and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer must be consulted; 
•    On resolution of an information security incident or weakness, the investigating officer must prepare a report that includes a detailed problem analysis, action(s) taken, and recommendations for corrective action or improvements
•    Information security incident reports must be submitted to Information Owners, Information Custodians, senior management, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and Risk 
Management Branch and Government Security Office as part of security program management. 
9.2.1 c) Monitoring and evaluating security incident management and response 
The Information Security Branch, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, is the centre of expertise and an essential capability in security incident protection, detection, response and correction where staff assigned responsibility for Information incident management receive special training in managing crises across the spectrum of potential incidents. 
 
The Information Security Branch must provide incident information to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and Risk Management Branch and Government Security Office as the focus of security incident reporting, management and improvement within government. Information sharing with stakeholder and partner organizations, other provincial security incident response centres and national incident response centres should also be fostered. Information security incident response must be integrated within the broader requirements for business continuity and disaster recovery. Integration will simplify processes, maintain consistency and eliminate duplication. 
 
Continuous improvement of security incident management processes includes: 
•    Monitoring incidents using statistical analysis of frequency, types and locations of security incidents; 
•    Analysis of incidents, responses and successful containment; 
•    Determining requirements for user awareness and training; 
•    Improving the security of information systems through monitoring and reporting
•    Integrating automated alarms and other security incident detection technology with user reporting, checking logs and auditing systems.
