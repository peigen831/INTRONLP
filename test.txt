Purpose:     To establish comprehensive information security policies, processes and practices that will assist Ministries in delivering services.
1.1.1 a) Information Security Policy 
The Information Security Policy contains operational policies, standards, guidelines and metrics intended to establish minimum requirements for the secure delivery of government services. Secure service delivery requires the assurance of confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy of government information assets through: 
•    Management and business processes that include and enable security processes; 
•    Ongoing personnel awareness of security issues; 
•    Physical security requirements for information systems; 
•    Governance processes for information technology; 
•    Reporting information security events and weaknesses; 
•    Creating and maintaining business continuity plans
•    Monitoring for compliance. 
 
The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer recognizes that information security is a process, which to be effective, requires management commitment, the active participation of all personnel and ongoing awareness programs. The process for developing and maintaining policy is outlined in CIO Policy Development - Governance and Procedures (under review).

1.1.1 b) Ministry or agency information security policy 
Ministries may develop and implement additional information security policies, standards and guidelines for use within their organization or for a specific information system or program. Ministry developed information security policies, standards and guidelines can exceed but must not conflict with the baseline established by the Information Security Policy. 
 
Ministries must provide the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer with copies of any locally developed information security policies, standards or guidelines. 
 
A central repository must be maintained by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer for the collection and re-use of Ministry developed information security policies, standards or guidelines. 
Standards: 
Where standards exist they are included in individual policies. The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer will issue and revise government standards as needed.
